        <li> Get a large pot of water on to boil, season it heavily with salt.</li><br> 

<li>Finely chop one garlic clove and place in a small bowl; set aside. Thinly slice remaining garlic cloves; set aside.</li><br>  

<li>Finely chop half of the lemon (making sure to remove any seeds), add to the bowl with the finely chopped garlic and season with salt and pepper; set aside, this is for topping the pasta later. Set the rest of the lemon aside for squeezing over.</li> <br> 

<li>Heat olive oil and butter (if using) in a large skillet over medium heat. Add shallots and thinly sliced garlic and season with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until they’re lightly browned at the edges, but mostly starting to melt into each other into a sort of translucent paste, 8–10 minutes. Add anchovies, capers, and crushed red pepper flakes, stirring to encourage the anchovies to melt into the oil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until you’ve got a thick, concentrated paste, just a few minutes. Taste it—it should be almost too intense, too salty, and definitely not “saucy” (you dilute the paste with pasta water). Set this aside (you can make this a few hours ahead of time—a few days, if you wanted. If I were smart, I’d figure out how to bottle this stuff so you can use it any time).cups pasta water—we are using it, I promise).</li> <br> 

<li>Cook the pasta, stirring often (I like tongs for this, too), until the pasta is al dente and the sauce has thickened, 3–5 minutes. Add herbs and toss to coat, adding a splash or two of pasta water if you feel like it needs it. Despite the original mixture not being “saucy,” your end result should most definitely be saucy.</li> <br> 

<li>To serve, divide among bowls (or eat out of skillet), squeezing lemon juice over and scattering over some of that lemon-garlic mixture.</li> <br>

<li>Divide meat of your choice into 4–5 pieces (approximately 3–4 ounces each), rolling each gently into a little ball. I like to do this on a sheet tray, especially if doing a lot at once.</li> <br>

<li>Meanwhile, heat a large cast iron skillet over high heat until very, very hot.</li>  <br>

<li>Toast bun in skillet until lightly golden. Heat the bottom of the spatula for a few seconds on the hot pan, then add patty (two if there’s room) to the skillet and smash it with the spatula until it’s very thin. Cook, without moving it, until it’s very crispy and browned. Add some onions to the patty, press them in with the spatula, then flip. Add a slice of American cheese to the top of each patty and continue to cook until the cheese is melted and the onions on the bottom are nice and griddled. Repeat this process with the remaining patties. If you’re making a lot of burgers, carefully wipe your skillet between batches to avoid any super burnt pieces.</li> <br>

<li>Assemble the burgers to your liking. The HM order of operations is mustard on bottom bun, pickles, patty, more raw onion on top, sheet of iceberg, top bun.</li> <br>
